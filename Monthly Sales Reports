In this SQL, I used a database of multiple tables answer questions about past sales of the company.

#1 How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT (orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'ORDER ib';

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT (product)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity), 
product, 
SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE feb.quantity>2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'order ID';

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;
